# Librarium Project Guide

## Main Objectives

-   Build a library app following the MDN [this tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website) up to step 11
- Then build a page with one of two features:  
    - OCR upload page: allow a user to upload a file, run an OCR library on it, and display the text below  
- Finally, containerize the app using Docker

## Resources

- Clone in VSCode
- Set up python venv
- Build a basic Django app
- Dockerize it. I think we need to do this early.
- Try running the Docker app locally
- Continue going through the Django tutorial
- Test out pyTesseract
- Build OCR page
- Clean up UI
- Final code cleanup
